# CompactTree-Paper
Repository to store data/figures for CompactTree paper.

* **[`programs`](programs)** - Simple programs to benchmark each of the tools
    * **[`programs/benchmark.py`](programs/benchmark.py)** - The main program that runs the entire benchmark
* **[`figures`](figures)** - Directory where the figures will be output
    * **[`figures/figures.py`](figures/figures.py)** - Script that will generate the figures

To run the benchmark:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/niemasd/CompactTree-Paper.git
rm -rf results figures/*.pdf
python3 programs/benchmark.py results
python3 figures/figures.py results
```

## Datasets
Benchmarking was performed on trees simulated under the Yule model with a rate of *Î»* = 1 using the [Dual Birth Simulator](https://github.com/niemasd/Dual-Birth-Simulator) ([Moshiri, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1101/226423)).
