## Datasets
Benchmarking was performed on trees simulated under the Yule model with a rate of *Î»* = 1 using the [Dual Birth Simulator](https://github.com/niemasd/Dual-Birth-Simulator) ([Moshiri, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1101/226423)).

Benchmarked was also performed using [`2022.10.phylogeny.id.nwk`](http://ftp.microbio.me/greengenes_release/current/2022.10.phylogeny.id.nwk), which is the 2022-10-28 release of [Greengenes2](https://greengenes2.ucsd.edu/) ([McDonald *et al.*, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01845-1)).
